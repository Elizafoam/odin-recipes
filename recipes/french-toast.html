    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>French toast is a dish of sliced bread 
        soaked in beaten eggs and often milk or 
        cream, then pan fried. Alternative names 
        and variants include "eggy bread", "Bombay 
        toast", "gypsy toast", and "poor knights" 
        (of Windsor).
    </p>
    <p>The dish usually served for breakfast in which 
        bread is dipped into eggs and seasonings and 
        then fried to a golden brown. French toast is 
        often topped with butter, preserves, or syrup. 
        It is often used as a method to use up French 
        bread that is a day or two old and has started 
        to dry out.

        <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
        <li>1 cup whipped cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 100 degrees F (40 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat mashed strawberries and 1/2 cup white sugar in a 
            saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Mix cornstarch and water together in a bowl, then stir 
            into the strawberries.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat 
            to low and simmer while preparing remaining ingredients, 
            stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the milk and eggs in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Mash cream cheese, vanilla extract, and 3/4 cup white sugar 
            in a bowl until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spread the cream cheese mixture over a triangle-shaped piece of 
            bread, and top with another piece. Repeat with remaining bread 
            and cream cheese mixture to make 8 triangle-shaped sandwiches.</li>
        <li>Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Dip the sandwiches into the egg mixture, 2 or 3 at a time, and place 
            in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Transfer pan-fried sandwiches to a baking sheet and place in the 
            preheated oven to keep warm while cooking remaining sandwiches.</li>
        <li>To serve, top French toast with warm strawberry glaze and sliced fresh 
            strawberries and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Serve with a dollop 
            of whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
