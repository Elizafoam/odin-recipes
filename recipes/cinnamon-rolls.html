    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cinnamon roll is a sweet baked dough 
        filled with a cinnamon-sugar filling. 
        Made with a rich dough leavened with 
        yeast, their characteristic form is 
        due to rolling a dough sheet containing 
        sweetened cinnamon filling. Common toppings 
        for cinnamon rolls include cream cheese 
        frosting or a sugar glaze.</p>
    <p>The cinnamon rolls we know today are thought 
        to have originated in Sweden. There, they 
        are called kanelbulle and are celebrated on 
        October 4th as a national holiday. In the US, 
        cinnamon rolls' popularity began in the southern 
        states and later expanded through the whole nation.</p>
